# NBA GM Team Selection Game

Hello and welcome to the NBA GM Team Selection Game.

We (Sam Aki & Josh Peachey) both love basketball and wanted to make a fun little game to test our newly acquired React skills.

You are the General Manager of an NBA team and have been tasked with filling out a roster with a set budget of $150,000,000.

Your team must:

1. Have at least 8 players in it
2. Contain a mix of Guards, Forwards and Centres
3. Not exceed the $150,000,000 salary cap

Good luck!
