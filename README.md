___
### Brief
- After learning the basics of React, we (Sam Aki & Josh Peachey) set out to create a fun, interactive, single-page application on a theme we both love, NBA Basketball.

___
### Approach
- From the outset, we sought to create a game that can help anyone understand how the salary cap works in the NBA. 

- We therefore knew that we would need specific data associated with each available player, and to keep a track of the running salary total for the user's team.
