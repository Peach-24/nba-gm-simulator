### Brief

- After learning the basics of React, we (Sam Aki & Josh Peachey) set out to create a fun, interactive, single-page application on a theme we both love, NBA Basketball.

---

### Approach

- From the outset, we sought to create a game that can help anyone understand how the salary cap works in the NBA.

- We therefore knew that we would need specific data associated with each available player, and to keep a track of the running salary total for the user's team.

- We further developed the game by adding in the logic behind the rules (above), and a scoring system which encourages the player to try get the best team rating they could (the average player rating).

- As the user is required to consider different information when making decisions, we designed the app to be a desktop game.
